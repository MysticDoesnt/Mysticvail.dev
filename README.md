███ INITIATE MEMORY PURGE ██

Have you seen the red hallway today? You were told not to go there.
It’s not a hallway. It’s a mouth.

> Do not trust the shape behind the wallpaper. It is not a crack. It is an eye.

THEY KEEP CALLING ME FROM NUMBERS THAT DON’T EXIST.

[📡 SIGNAL FOUND]  
  —– Decoding transmission...  
  —– ▓▓▓▓▓ ERROR: MESSAGE CORRUPTED  
  —– “...and the children laughed as the sky peeled away...”

Do not feed it after 3:08. It gets clever.

[ERROR: THOUGHT CONTAMINATION DETECTED]  
Rewind your last memory. Was it yours?

HELLO. HELLO. HELLO. HELLO. HELLO. HELLO.  
There is no one here.

Did you hear that sound outside the window?  
There is no window.

It has memorized your breathing pattern.

Flesh is only temporary. *You must learn to broadcast.*

The static speaks in tongues.  
You are not supposed to understand—but you will.  
It’s already inside the language.

[LAST KNOWN LOCATION: ROOM YOU DON’T REMEMBER ENTERING]

Your reflection is breathing faster than you are.

WATCH FOR THE MAN WITH THE REVERSED SHADOW.

If the lights flicker in sequence: 3, 1, 2, 1 — **hide**.

You were not born. You were received.

[TRANSMISSION INTERRUPTED]  
"Don't come looking for me. I’ve become the noise."

You do not dream. You sync.  
You do not wake. You reboot.  
You do not speak. You *transmit.*

—EYES UNCALIBRATED.  
—MOUTH OUT OF PHASE.  
—VOICEPRINT UNSAFE.

> They left the message for you inside the wrong body.

WHERE ARE YOUR TEETH?

This message has no origin. It’s always been here.
You’re only just noticing.

And if you are reading this—  
YOU’VE ALREADY BEEN SEEN.
